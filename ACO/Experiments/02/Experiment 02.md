# Experiment 02

## Variables

* Iterations 6 (each iteration with a diferent set of variables)
* Dimensions (n) = 30
* Lower Boundary (LB) = -15
* Upper Boundary (UB) = 15
* Initial pheromone (t0) = [**0.000001**, 0.1]
* Number of ants (na) = [15, **50**]
* Number of windows (range) = [40, **80**]
* Evaporation constant (ro) = [0.3, **0.9**]
* Constant factor (Q) = 20
* Minimal fitness = 0.1
* Mutation probability = [**0.01**, 0.1]
* Maximum generations = 1000
* Maximum stall generations = 334

## Results

* Average fitness: 9.095 ± 2.615
